3x3 Matrix Calculator

A lightweight Python calculator that performs statistical operations on 3x3 matrices. This tool computes six fundamental functions for matrix analysis.
Features:
•	Mean (Average of all elements)
•	Variance (Population variance)
•	Standard Deviation (Population std)
•	Min (Smallest value)
•	Max (Largest value)
•	Sum (Total of all elements)
Usage:
1.	Input your 3x3 matrix row by row
2.	Select an operation from the menu
3.	Get instant statistical results

Perfect for quick linear algebra computations, educational purposes, or data analysis workflows. Handles integer and floating-point values.
________________________________________
Key elements in this description:
•	Clearly specifies the matrix dimension (3x3)
•	Lists all operations in a scannable format
•	Highlights practical use cases
•	Mentions supported data types
•	Maintains technical accuracy while being accessible
•	Uses GitHub-friendly formatting (headers, bullet points)

This provides essential information without overwhelming readers, making it suitable for both technical users and educators. You can expand this later with installation steps, code examples, or API details if the project grows.
